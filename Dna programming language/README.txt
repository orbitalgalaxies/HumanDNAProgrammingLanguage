DNA Programming Language - README
=====================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This project implements a revolutionary programming language that uses DNA nucleotide sequences 
as source code. The language employs a 2-bit encoding scheme where each DNA nucleotide represents 
exactly 2 bits, allowing 4 nucleotides to encode 1 byte of binary data.

ENCODING SCHEME
---------------
A = 00 (binary)
U = 01 (binary) 
C = 10 (binary)
G = 11 (binary)

This means 4 DNA nucleotides = 8 bits = 1 byte = 1 instruction

INSTRUCTION SET
---------------
The language supports 13 basic operations:

AAAA (00000000) - NOP    : No operation
AAAU (00000001) - LOAD   : Load value into register A
AAAC (00000010) - STORE  : Store register A value to memory
AAAG (00000011) - ADD    : Add value to register A
AAUA (00000100) - SUB    : Subtract value from register A
AAUU (00000101) - MUL    : Multiply register A by value
AAUC (00000110) - DIV    : Divide register A by value
AAUG (00000111) - PRINT  : Print register A value
AACA (00001000) - INPUT  : Input value to register A
AACU (00001001) - JMP    : Jump to address
AACC (00001010) - JEQ    : Jump if equal
AACG (00001011) - JNE    : Jump if not equal
AAGA (00001100) - HALT   : Stop program execution

FEATURES
--------
✓ Complete virtual machine with 256 bytes memory
✓ 4 registers (A, B, C, D) for data manipulation
✓ DNA source code compilation to binary bytecode
✓ Binary bytecode decompilation back to DNA
✓ File I/O operations (save/load .dna binary files)
✓ Universal data storage (convert ANY file to DNA format)
✓ Perfect lossless conversion between DNA and binary
✓ Full disassembler for debugging
✓ Direct compatibility with existing computer systems

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies required

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Download "Human DNA as a programming language final.txt"
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system
3. No additional setup required - ready to run!

USAGE
-----
To run the DNA programming language interpreter:

    python "Human DNA as a programming language final.txt"

This will execute the demo program which:
- Compiles a DNA source program
- Shows binary representation
- Demonstrates file I/O
- Executes the program
- Shows universal data encoding capabilities

EXAMPLE PROGRAM
---------------
DNA Source: AAAU AACA AAUC AAAG AAAU AAAC AAAA AAUG AAGA

This translates to:
1. LOAD  - Load value 42
2. INPUT - (demo operation)
3. DIV   - Division operation  
4. ADD   - Add 8
5. LOAD  - Load another value
6. STORE - Store to memory
7. NOP   - No operation
8. PRINT - Print result (outputs: 9)
9. HALT  - Stop execution

BINARY COMPATIBILITY
--------------------
The DNA language is fully compatible with binary systems:
- Each 4-nucleotide sequence maps to exactly 1 byte
- Programs can be saved as standard binary files (.dna extension)
- Any binary file can be converted to DNA representation
- Perfect round-trip conversion guaranteed

UNIVERSAL DATA STORAGE
----------------------
The system can encode ANY type of data as DNA:
- Text files → DNA sequences
- Images → DNA sequences  
- Audio → DNA sequences
- Video → DNA sequences
- Binary executables → DNA sequences

Example: "Hello, World!" becomes:
UACAUCUUUCGAUCGAUCGGACGAACAAUUUGUCGGUGACUCGAUCUAACAU

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
------------------------
Memory Architecture:
- 256 bytes of addressable memory
- 4 general-purpose registers (A, B, C, D)
- Program counter for instruction tracking
- Stack-based execution model

File Format:
- Source files: Plain text DNA sequences
- Compiled files: Standard binary format (.dna extension)
- Cross-platform compatibility

Performance:
- Maximum storage density: 4 nucleotides per byte
- Zero overhead encoding/decoding
- Direct binary execution

APPLICATIONS
------------
1. Bioinformatics research and education
2. Novel data storage mechanisms
3. Cryptographic applications using biological metaphors
4. Educational programming language for biology students
5. Artistic coding projects combining biology and computing
6. Research into alternative computing paradigms

DEVELOPMENT
-----------
The language includes a complete development environment:
- Compiler (DNA → binary bytecode)
- Decompiler (binary bytecode → DNA)
- Virtual machine executor
- Disassembler for debugging
- File I/O system
